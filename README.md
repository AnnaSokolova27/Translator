This Repository is dedicated to creating a program that can translate different idioms without changing their meanings. It is based on the library googletrance and uses different libraries for NLP to add new translations for some idioms. For example, the idiom "by the skin of your teeth" is translated into Russian correctly by this translator while some other translators translate it literally, without pointing to the real meaning. Another example is the idiom "cry wolf". You need to analyze different grammatical features of a whole sentence to translate accurately the idiom in this sentence. This translator takes into account such grammatical features as verbs tenses, noun number and some other to make translation more correct.
